# Bearing-Model
 I modelled a bearing prototype model using langrangian mechanics and predicated its movement using the RK4 method. The language used was python
 The model has a urdf file and is the component of a BCD Rotar. 
 The package used was pybullet and the Physics GUI Simulator.
 My task was to explain the physics behind it's movement and predict what angle would the arm attached to the bearing make after a certain amount of time
 and what would be the position co-ordinate on the y-axis
 The prototype is constrained to move only in the y-direction and an initial torque is given to it 
 After reaching a certain RPM the bearing is released and is allowed to only move in the y-axis.
